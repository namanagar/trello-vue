# Trello Clone - Vue

This is a frontend clone of the kanban management app Trello using Vue.js and Bootstrap. 
Some of the features (authentication specifically) are incorrectly implemented - this is due to the project specification found [here.](https://www2.cs.duke.edu/courses/compsci290.2/spring18/assign/06_trello/) 

It was originally built in the course of two weeks for CS 290 Web Application Development at Duke University, Spring 2018. I received a grade of 96.8% on it.
